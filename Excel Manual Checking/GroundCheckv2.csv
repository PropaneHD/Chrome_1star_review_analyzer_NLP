200,Man o man am I ever glad I didn't update this app . After reading the reviews I have realized it would not be a good idea to update it. So for now I'm going to stick with the previous version. One would assume that the smart people at Google would do a bit more research before fixing something that isn't broke. For the most part Google has been pretty good for me so I hope the next update will be a little more thought out and have a lot more positive reviews because this one had practically none,1,0.9571,0,,

I got a tip for those who *accidently* updated chrome. Uninstall it and then don't update again And for the people with pc browser, use Brave browser, it is really nice working browser better than chrome nowadays.

206,"Worked just as desired until the update that forced tab groups. I don't want or need groups, so please give us the option of doing this instead of forcing it on us. At least give me the option to open a link into the same tab group. Why does it only give the option to open in a new group?! Google chrome? More like Google fail.

208,"Buggy as of Feb 2021. Many sites don't work or the app freezes. Took away desktop mode before you ask for a web page when adding a new tab so sites send you to Google play store and they don't give you a chance to use them in desktop mode, New bugs especially in page organizing functions. If they fix all the recent bugs created in the past 2 months & had the ability to save websites to view later or open in the background like Firefox it would get 5 stars",1,0.9062,0,,

I don't need mini views of each open page to remind me what I've been doing - I'm not an idiot - and I definitely don't need a piece of my screen real estate taken over to show me what tabs belong to the group.
